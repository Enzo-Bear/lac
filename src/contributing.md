# Contributing to the ProLUG Linux Sysadmin Course Book

The Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG) has a set of requirements and guidelines to
contribute to this project. Below are a set of steps to ensure contributors are adhering
to those guidelines and fostering a productive version control environment.

We also ask all contributors to observe GitHub decorum and refrain from offensive language and content.

## Signing your Git Commits with SSH

Signing GitHub commits helps ProLUG validate incoming commits from trusted, and serious contributors.
It can be quite trivial to impersonate users on GitHub and it is in the best interest of those involved
to observe this security practice.

- Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  ```
- Add SSH public key ('.pub' suffix) to github as "Signing Key".
  <img src="./assets/images/addkey.png"></img> \* Settings -> GPG and SSH Keys -> Add SSH Key -> Dropdown -> Signing Key
* Configure git locally to use the SSH key to sign your commits.
    * Here's a script that will do that.

      Run these commands one by one or run the block as a script.
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      GH_USERNAME="YourUsername"
      git config --global gpg.format ssh
      git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
      git config --global tag.gpgSign true
      git config --global commit.gpgSign true
      mkdir -p ~/.config/git
      touch ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
      echo "${GH_USERNAME} $(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" > ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
      git config --global gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
      # Make a commit to verify
      git log --show-signature -1
      ```
    * Make a commit after running those commands and then use `git log --show-signature -1`.
    * You should see something like `Good "git" signature for <yourname> with ED25519 key SHA256:abcdef...` if it worked.

Your commits should now be verified from your account. This helps us ensure that valid users are
contributing to this project. Unverified commits will be scrutinized and likely discarded.

## Syncing your Fork with the Upstream ProLUG Repo

<img src="./assets/images/syncfork.png"></img>

In an effort to minimize merge conflicts we strongly suggest forks remain up to date with
the original repository before committing changes. This will help us reduce pull request management overhead.

<div class = warning>
Pull requests with substantial merge conflicts may be rejected.
</div>

You can do this from the GitHub web UI easily with the `Sync Fork` button. If you want to do this from the terminal, you can add a new `git remote` called `upstream`.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac.git
```

Then, to sync your local fork with the original repo, do a `git pull` from the `upstream` remote.

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

Then your fork is up to date with the original upstream repo.

## Basic Contribution Workflow

You'll create your own fork of the repository using the GitHub web UI, create a
branch, make changes, push to your fork, then open a pull request.

### Create a Fork

- Go to the [original repository link](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac).
- Click on "Fork" on the top right.
- Now you'll have your own version of the repository that you can clone.

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/lac.git
  # Or, with https:
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lac.git
  ```

### Clone the Fork to your Local Machine

Then you'll need to clone your fork down to your local machine in order to work on it.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourname/lac.git
```

### Create a New Branch

Whenever making changes contributors are highly encouraged to create a branch with an
appropriate name. Switch to that branch, then make changes there.

For example, if you're working on the Unit 1 Worksheet:

```bash
git branch unit1-worksheet
git switch unit1-worksheet
# Or, simply:
git switch -c unit1-worksheet
```

Make changes to the `u1ws.md`.

### Commit and Push your Changes

First make sure your forked repo is [up-to-date with the original](#syncing-your-fork-with-the-original).
Create your commit (make sure it's [signed](#signing-your-git-commits-with-ssh)!), then push changes to **your own fork** on the new branch.

```bash
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
git push origin unit1-worksheet
```

### Comment your Changes

Before creating a pull request, make a comment on the issue containing your changes.  
We're doing this since the GitHub organization feature is paid and we are doing this for free, so there is only one person who is able to merge pull requests at the moment.

### Create a Pull Request

Now you'll be able to go to the [original repository link](https://github.com/ProfessionalLinuxUsersGroup/lac) and go to the "Pull Requests" tab and create a new pull request.
Select your branch `unit1-worksheet`, and create a description and mention an issue by number (e.g., `#5`).
