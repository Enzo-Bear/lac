        <h1>Unit 14 Introduction: Ansible Automation</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

This unit introduces **Ansible Automation**, a powerful open-source tool used for IT automation, configuration management, and application deployment. By the end of this unit, you will understand how to implement Ansible in enterprise environments to manage Linux infrastructure efficiently.

### What is the skill/tech/concept we are dealing with?

1. **Configuration Management:** Automate system configurations across multiple hosts.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define infrastructure using Ansible playbooks.
3. **Automation:** Execute tasks across multiple systems in an efficient, repeatable manner.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Set up and configure Ansible on a Linux system.
- Understand Ansible inventory and playbooks.
- Automate common administrative tasks.
- Use ad-hoc commands and Ansible modules effectively.

## Relevance & Context

### Why is it important to Linux Administrators/Engineers?

1. **Consistency:** Automate repetitive tasks to ensure uniform configurations.
2. **Scalability:** Manage thousands of servers with minimal manual intervention.
3. **Security & Compliance:** Enforce policies and reduce misconfigurations.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this unit, ensure you understand:

1. Basic Linux command-line operations.
2. SSH and remote system management.
3. YAML syntax and basic scripting.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Playbook:** A YAML-based script defining automation tasks.
- **Task:** A single operation executed by Ansible.
- **Inventory:** A list of systems Ansible will manage.
- **Ad-hoc Commands:** One-time command execution without a playbook.
- **Roles:** Modular units of automation to structure playbooks.
