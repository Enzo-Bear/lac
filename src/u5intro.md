# Unit 5

## Overview 

### What is the concept we are dealing with?  


This unit focuses on managing user's environments and scanning and enumerating Systems. 

- Become familiar with networking scanning tools
- Understand the functionality systems files and customized .(dot) files.

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Become familiar with Networking mapping:**
   
   * Learn how to find your network inventory by using nmap.
   * Grasp the basics of targeted scans by scanning virtual boxes and creating a report.
  
2. **Explore the system files:**

* Understand the structure of the /etc/passwd file by using the cat command.
* Customize the /etc/skel file to create a default shell environment for the users. 

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking.
- Familiarity with nmap.
- Intermediate understanding of file manipulation commands.
- General idea of bash scripting.

## Key Terms and Definitions

**Footprinting** – The process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization to understand its security posture.

**Scanning** – The action to investigate the system to identify open ports, services, vulnerabilities, and system details.

**Enumeration** – The process of extracting information from a target system, such as user accounts, network shares, and system configurations.

**System Hacking** – Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to a system.

**Escalation of Privilege** – Gaining higher-level access than originally granted by exploiting system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Rule of Least Privilege** – A security principle that focuses on users, applications, and systems that should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.

**Covering Tracks** – The process of erasing evidence of an attack to avoid detection.  Which includes clearing logs, modifying timestamps, using rootkits, or disabling security monitoring tools.

**Planting Backdoors** – Installing hidden access mechanisms that allow you to re-enter a compromised system without detection.
