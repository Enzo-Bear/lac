### Instructions
A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned topics. Take the time
to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction
with peers is also expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of
knowledge.

#### Discussion Post #1
Review the page: https://attack.mitre.org/  
1. What terms and concepts are new to you?  

2. Why, as a system administrator and not directly in security, do you think it’s so important to understand how your systems can be attacked? Isn’t it someone else’s problem to think about that?  

3. What impact to the organization is data exfiltration? Even if you’re not a data owner or data custodian, why is it so important to understand the data on your systems?

1. What types of customizations might you setup for your environment? Why?  

2. What problems can you anticipate around helping users with their dot files?
