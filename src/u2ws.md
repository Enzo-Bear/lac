# Unit 2 Worksheet

## Intro
Unit 2 is all about essential tools.  
Working with files, redirecting output, and managing permissions are all fundamental
skills that any Linux sysadmin will need.

### Instructions  
A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.


#### Unit 2 Discussion Post 1
Think about how week 1 went for you.  
1.	Do you get everything you needed to done?  

2.	Do you need to allocate more time to the course, and if so, how do you plan to do it?  

3.	How well did you take notes during the lecture? Do you need to improve this?  
 

#### Unit 2 Discussion Post 2 
Read a blog, check a search engine, or ask an AI about SELINUX.  
What is the significance of contexts? What are the significance of labels?

Scenario:  
> You follow your company instructions to add a new user to a set of 10 Linux servers.  
They cannot access just one (1) of the servers.  
When you review the differences in the servers you see that the server they cannot access is running SELINUX.  
On checking other users have no problem getting into the system.  
You find nothing in the documentation (typical) about this different system or how these users are accessing it.  
What do you do?  
Where do you check? (you may use any online resources to help you answer this. This is not a trick and it is not a “one answer solution”.  This is for you to think through.)

## Digging Deeper  

1.	How does troubleshooting differ between system administration and system engineering? To clarify, how might you troubleshoot differently if you know a system was previously running correctly v. if you’re building a new system out?  

2.	Investigate a troubleshooting methodology, by either google or AI search.  
    Does the methodology fit for you in an IT sense, why or why not?  

## Reflection Questions  

1.	What questions do you still have about this week?  

2.	How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?
